# CRUD

This is a file of a project that I did to explore writing code with CRUD operations and its approaches.

## What is [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)? (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

The attached java file contains 5 cases that allows system input for the following:

INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SEARCH, DISPLAY

## What I Did:

I created an Employee Collection Class with 3 instance variables: 
int empno, String ename, int salary

I encapsulated the variables and initialized them with a constructor and wrote public getter's methods and a toString method for the program. 

Diving into the main method, I created a List Collection for various Employees. 

The entire program is essentially within a do -> while loop and using switch statements that will run based on unique cases (which reflect the CRUD operations above).
